#Design Outline
 - Left 80% board, right 20% player information/chat
   - Player information on top, chat on bottom (small)
 - Interactions a la visual novels / ATLUS games
 - Tiles are rhombuses to emulate 3d viewpoint
   - Icons on tiles similarly distorted
   - Tiles can be elevated, just need to be placed to look realistic..?
 - Ambient music..? where would we get this tho
