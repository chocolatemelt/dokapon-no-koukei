##Starting
Characters are created with a name and a class. No stat points are allocated; instead, they are randomly rolled (without significant variation) based on player input. For example, see below table:
Stat | Player A | Player B
---- | -------- | --------
Talents | (+STR,-DEX) | (+DEX,-INT)
STR | 23 | 15
DEX | 8 | 22
INT | 14 | 9
Note that the strong stats are clearly better than the unmodified stats, and the unmodified stats are clearly better than the weak stats. While there will be variation within a tier, each tier will be well above the next so that everyone starts out equally.
This reduces time spent setting up the game as well as introducing more variability in the early game while preserving the late game.

##Stat Explanations / Math
Luck: Either directly affects RNG or builds up after "unlucky" events, culminating in a free "choice" event (choose the outcome)
